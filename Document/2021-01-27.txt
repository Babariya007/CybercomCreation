=>  If we use static keyword in object then we can use name of the class
=>  In shoort static member use the name of the class and intance members invoke using instance or object of the class
=>  We not use access modifire in static constructor also use initialize static fildes
=>  Wf we not give any access modifire of class name then it's by default private
=>  In inheritance multiple inheritance not support in C# other all supports in C#
=>  Method hidding also using new keyword
=>  Polimorephisem - in derived class any method of derived class override use virtual method and we use override keyword in override method
=>  Polimerphism enable are to invoke dirived class method using a base class refrance veriable at run time this a polimorphism
=>  In overriding we use virtual method for base class and use override keyword in Derived class, and method hinding we use new keyword in derived class
=>  In method overriding we use base class reference variable pointing to child class object
=>  In method overloading we can use same method name but diffrent type of parameter or diff argument
