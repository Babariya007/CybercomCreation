=>  Today start a Databse Series.
=>  In today i have complete all the videos and Learn the topics are
	- Connecting to SQL Server
	- Creating, altering and dropping a database
	- Creating and working with tables
	- Adding a default constraint
	- Cascading referential integrity constraint
	- Adding a check constraint
	- Identity Column
	- get the last generated identity column value
	- Unique key constraint
	- Group by
	- Joins
	- Advanced or intelligent joins in sql server



=>  Today i have also learn from above topics from database:

=>  If we create a new Database, table, view etc then we can use create keyword

=>  Alter and rename databse or table

=>  We can not delete system databases

=>  Primary key is use for uniqe record in table

=>  Learn Default Constraint it use if over requirement is not enter data at any column then store difault value using default constraints
=>  If one table id give another table using forain key and delete one row then we can not able to delete those row.
	- Then we can use Cascading Referential Integrity. There are 4 types: No Action, Cascade, Set Null, Set Default
	- No Action : The no action is by default selected and it generate error at delete time
	- Cascade : It is use for delete primary table data with forain table data
	- Set Null : If we delete primary table column then set null at foreign table
	- Set Default : If we delete primary table column then set Default value at foreign table but default constaint must be required

=>  If we some condition on data insert time then we can also use Constrain in some condition.
	- Ex: If data insert time anyone data add in age less then 0 or more then 120 then give error do not enter data in table
	- If we add Constrain then quary is
		ALTER TABLE {TABLE_NAME}
		ADD CONSTRAINT {CONSTRAINT_NAME} CHECK {BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION}
	- And if the delete constraint then,
		ALTER TABLE {TABLE_NAME}
		DROP CONSTRAINT {CONSTRAINT_NAME}

=>  The Identity column is use for Identify values ex: in ID by default increment by 1 and every id is uniqe then use identity column
	- If we can add data on deletd ID 1 then we can first on the Identity then we can able to add record
	- We can also start with any id to add record using DBCC CHECKIDENT({TABLE_NAME}, RESEED, start_number_with-1)

=>  If we can retrive last data of identity then there three ways
	- scope_identity() : we can direct use scope_identity() function. It can return value only same session record.
	- @@identity : Here also retrive last key value we insert or also called give a last identity. 
	- ident_current({TABLE_NAME}) : it can show to any session of record update.

=>  If we can add some data like User name then we can use Unique key
	- We can use more then one unique in one table but not able to use more then one primary key
	- The Major diffrence in Primary key and Unique is Primary key dosen't allow null value but unique allow only one null value

=>  Group by is use to group a select a set of rows for summary or one or more columns or expressions.
	- It is also always use one or more aggregate function

=>  The aggrigate functions are:
	- COUNT: counts how many rows are in a particular column.
	- SUM: adds together all the values in a particular column.
	- MIN: and MAX return the lowest and highest values in a particular column, respectively.
	- AVG: calculates the average of a group of selected values.
	- Also other aggrigate functions are CHECKSUM_AGG, COUNT, COUNT_BIG, GROUPING, GROUPING_ID

=>  The joins are use for show data retrive for some condition. The types are join:
	- crose join : Return Cartesian product of the tables involved in the join
	- Inner join : Return only the matching rows. Non matching rows are eliminated
	- Left join : Return all the matching rows and Non matching rows from left Table
	- Right Join : Return all the matching rows and Non matching rows from right Table
	- full join : Return all rows from both tables, including the non-matching rows.


=>  In comparision of any data in SQL Server database then not use '=' sign it can use 'IS'



=>  Also solved my Qustion from Sir 
	- where and why to use Analysis Service, Reporting Service, Integration Service
	- What is a actual use of system databases
	- In dotnet we can also use Server side validation then why use of constains for data insert time some condition
