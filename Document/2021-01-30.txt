=>  Got the use of StreamReader class
=>  In Exceton properties are
	- Message : Show the Exception Message
	- StackTrace : It is use for particular line number of Exception
=>  We can also write on perticular Exeption. Ex.: FileNotFound exception, Arethmetic exception,DivideByZero exception etc...
=>  We can also write perticular message for the user intraction
=>  the finally block is run at every time and the programmer use to release the memory or resorce
=>  The formate Exception is use to check the types Ex.: int, string etc...
=>  The use of exception we can handle some errors we can not write for every contion code
	Ex: If we create division program then the user also input large number, alfabets, put 0 in diviser and so on then we can not write all of those condition for codding we can simply use Exception and get the error message.
	    And user also mey not know than exception then we can use a manually exception or we also crete custom Exception
