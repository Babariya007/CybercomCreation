=>  DDL triggers fire in response to DDL Event.
	- DDL events - create, alter, drop, rename, etc

=>  In trigger first fire server scop trigger then fire database trigger.
	- We can also set which trigger fire first using system store procedure(sp_settriggerorder).

=>  The logon trigger use for Tracking login activity, Restricting logins to sql server, Limiting number of session for a specific login

=>  Select into is use to backup or copy of paerticular table in that database or external database.
	- The advantage is a the table all column or perticular column and data are copy into other table using one query.
	- 1 <> 1 is a Use of never true

=>  In the where we can not use aggricate function and in having by able to use aggrigate function.

=>  If we create user define data table then that query is
	- Create Type emp as table
	  (
		Id int primary key,
		Name varchar(50),
		gender varchar(10)
	  )

=>  In debugging Step Over : is use for next line excecution
	- Step intro: use for that refrance to point and that place goto debugging
	- Step Out: use for execute storeprocedure, function etc and wait to execute to next line
	- Run to Cursor: is use to if we know of process and that is correct then we goto other line then that line cursor to click and chose option
	- watch window: show the values of vriables

=>  The over clause combined with partition by is used to break up data into partitions.Specified function operates for each partition

=>  UNPIVOT operator is use to convert columns into rows

=>  The query of choose function : CHOOSE(index, value1, value2, etc)

=>  If we can use if condition in database then we can write IIF(bool_expression, bool_expression true , bool_expression flase )

=>  Use of the EOMonth is a find the lastdate of the given month.

=>  DATEPART() is use for any part of the dte retrive.

=>  DATEFROMPARTS function use for date value for the specified year, month and date

=>  In DateTime2FromParts function have a two parts. Date part and time part.
