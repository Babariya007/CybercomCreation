=>  Today I have votch and learn from videos :
	- Self join
	- Different ways to replace NULL Value
	- Coalesce function
	- Union and union all
	- Stored procedures
	- Stored procedures with output parameters
	- Stored procedure output parameters or return values
	- Built in string functions
	- LEFT, RIGHT, CHARINDEX and SUBSTRING functions
	- Replicate, Space, Patindex, Replace and Stuff string functions
	- Case Statement
	- DateTime functions


=>  Also i have learn this all things:
=>  Salf join use to joining table with itself.

=>  There are three waays to replace NULL valus
	- ISNULL(), COALESCE(), CASE

=>  Using the COALESCE() we can able to multipal null value replace.

=>  The Union and UnionAll use to combine the result-set of two or more select queries.
	- UNION remove duplicate rows, but UNION ALL dosen't remove duplicate rows
	- UNION is slower then UNION ALL, because in UNION is perform distinct sort
	- In union if we can retriv data one table two column and second table retrive data 3 column then it's generate error
	- The Column values and column position are must be same position on query.

=>  The Storeprocedure are execute three ways:
	- using Exec keyword, Execute Keyword and gui base from SQL Server
=>  We can use storeprocedure for insert, update, delete, select(View data) etc.
	- We can also use retrive data for pass value as parametarise.

=>  If the storeprocedure are encrepted then we can not able to view or add or edit of data
=>  sp_help is use for get information of storeprocedure, tables, triggers etc.
=>  sp_helptext is use for view storeprocedure text
=>  sp_depends use to know dependancies of storeprocedure

=>  Know about string functions. The string functions are :
	- ASCII(), CHAR(), LTRIM(), RTRIM(), LOWER(), UPPER(), REVERSE(), LEN()

=>  Datetime functions are :
	- IsDate(), Day(), Month(), Year(), DateName(), DatePart(), DateAdd(), DateDiff() etc...
=>  Also perform this all task in MySql Server.
