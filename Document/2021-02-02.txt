=>  Today Completed all the videos and learn topics are
	- Enums
	- Type and Type Member
	- Access Modifire
	- create class Library
	- Attributes
	- Reflection
	- Generics

=>  I have learn in Enum GetName(), GetNames(), GetValue(), etc...
=>  GetName return string and GetValue return number of position and position start with zero it's a array
=>  The use of Enum is to coed is to readeble or more maintanable and easly understood other programmer
	in enum type cast we can use same index number of itwms show
	- Ex: enum Day and Month are created then we Month typecast with day.
	  if Month month = (Month)Day.Wednesday; then its wednesday indexnumber and check in Month indexnumber and print month index number. in this result show April.
=> i also learn create a region for use of proper codding structure and more redable

=>  Also Learn Attribute and how to useful and how to create custome Attribute
=>  In generate custamize error using ObsoleteAttribute. Ex: we if we use a sum for using passing manually parameter then it's generate error and show the message please use List<> insted of passing object in method
=>  Learn from Early biding and late biding is in Early buiding is more prefreble because if any error ex: Speling mistake or any declaration then visual studio show before compilation but in late biding it's show the error at run time.

=>  In reflection useing is Type class
=>  using the reflection we can find methods, propertys, class, constructors etc... and we also find that return types
=>  If we reflection of contuctor then we can use .ToString() to use of advantage is it's return the constructor and pass the perameters show

=>  Generic is nothig but it is type indipended
=>  If we passing any type of data for process, or differnt data type we have to create same code so to overcome using generics. Show the Example
=>  public class Calculator<T>
    {
        public static bool AreEqual(T value1, T value2)
        {
            return value1.Equals(value2);
        }
    }
=>  know about refrance equality

=>  Aslo resolve my qustion for in Enum Why Conflict.
