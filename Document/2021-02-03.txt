	-collection class



- In those topic i have learn :

=>  Difference between String and StringBuilder
	- System.String is immutable and StringBuilder is Mutable
	- immutable is not change string after created but the Mutable string is modified/changeble string
	- If we concate string using StringBuilder then use Append Method and the StringBuilder is using for System.Text namespace

=>  The use of Partial class or structure using partial keyword
	- is provide to single class into multipal files and all these files are combine to compile time
	- The partial keyword is also used to split struct or interface into two or more files.

=>  The use of Partial Method is also partial keyword
	- The partial method is only teo part 
	    - Defination
	    - Implimentation
	- The use of partial method do not multipal imlimentating declarations
	- If we can not a impliment method then the C# complier is ignore that Method
	- This is by default private and we can not use any access modifires
	- Also use return type void because it's not any type of return in defination.

=>  Indexser 
	- There are two types of indexer. 1) int indexer and 2) string indexer
	- Using the indexser allow object like an array or we can use object using [] brecket like as array
	- using the indexser we can create special property just like geet and set, the get-set also use in indexer
	- we can use all access modifire with indexer
	- Indexer are also regular member of a class
	- It can use create with this keyword

=>  In Optional parameter the parameter array use last parameter other wise it's generate error

=>  We can use two ways to use optional method.
	- Using last parameter pram keyword
	- And using in last optionalAttribute

=>  The Code Snippet are handle are Code Snippet Manager

=>  Dictionary
	- Dictionary is a collection of key, value pairs.
	- It is provides faast lookups for value using keys.
	- The Key in dictionary is must be unique
	- In dictionary TryGetValue(), Count(), Remove(), Clear(), Convert in to array
=>  The List is increase size autometacly array is not increase size autometicaly

=>  Collection class
	- The List of Collection Class in functions is Contains(), Exists(), Find(), FindLast(), FindAll(), FindIndex(), FindLastIndex, Convert array to list,list to array and list to dictionary
