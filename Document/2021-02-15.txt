=>  Today i have complete all of videos and learn topics are:
	- Indexed views
	- Know about View limitations
	- Triggers
	- Insert or update trigger
	- Instead of insert trigger
	- Instead of update triggers
	- Instead of delete triggers
	- Derived tables and common table expressions
	- common table expressions
	- Update CTE
	- Recursive CTE
	- Database normalization
	- Pivot


=>  The view is a virtual table it dose not store any data by default.
	- If we create index on view then we can now able to store data in view. It's caled indexed view.
	- Konw about COUNT_BIG()

=>  In view we can not create parameterise view.
	- We can not able to create view for temporary table.

=>  There are three types of trigger
	- DML, DDL and Logon trigger
	- DML is a Data Manupulation Lunguage. In DML Insert, Update and Delete eventes use.
	- DML trigger are two types of trigger. 1) After trigger  2) Instead trigger
	- The after trigger fire after the insert, update and delete and the Instead trigger is fire insted of the triggring action.
	- DML trigger fire autometically to DML events(insert, update and delete)
	- In trigger have a inserted and deleted are two special tables for Inserted table contain newly add data and deleted table contain deleted rows

=>  CTE is called as Common Table Expression.
=>  The common table expression is a temparary result set
=>  Also prectice of them.
