=>  Today i have learn how to create Console application

=>  namespace : is collection of classes, interfaces, stucts, enums and delegates
    namespace is also use to other namespace.

=>  Learn Console.WriteLine and Console.ReadLine, the Console is also derive from system namespace.C# is also Case sensitive.

=>  we have two ways write Console.writeLine
	- Concatenation
	- Place holder Syntex

=>  Today i have also learn Types.
	-integral : byte, sbyte, char, int, long, short, ulong
	- floting type : float and double
	- decimal : use to store decimal values
	- string : it's use to ""
          use \n is also use for new line and write "\n"
          if we use single \ then use the \\ in string

=>  verbatim Literal
    if we use single \ and in string then we can use @ before(prefix) the ""

=>  Then learn nulleble and null coalesce operator. coalesce operator if the value is nullable and we set default value if item is null then use ?? (null coalesce operator)

=>  Typecasat: if we convert float to int using typecast and the float value is very big then it show the last value of integer but if we use convert class Convert.Int32 then it's show exsepction

=>  also learn Parse() and TryParse()

=>  also learn comments in C# for Singleline, Multi line and XML Document Comment
