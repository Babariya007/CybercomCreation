=>  Today i have a complete all the videos and cover topics are:
	- Caching dataset
	- SqlCommandBuilder
	- rejectchanges and dataset acceptchanges methods
	- Strongly typed datasets
	- Load xml data into sql server
	- Copying data from one table to another table
	- Transactions

=>  Today also learn about those topics:
=>  Caching is a technique of storing frequently used data/information in User local memory.
	- When the same data/information is needed next time, it could be directly retrieved from the memory instead of being generated by the application.
	- Using the Caching th server load are decrease.

=>  SqlCommandBuilder automatically generates INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE sql statements based on the SELECT statement for a single table.
	- SqlCommandBuilder generate using Set the "SelectCommand" property of the SqlDataAdapter object
	- Create an instance of SqlCommandBuilder class and the SqlDataAdapter object created above using DataAdapter property of the SqlCommandBuilder object

=>  Disconnected data access ADO.NET offers two data access modes
	- Connection oriented data access
	- Disconnected data access
	- SqlDataAdapter and DataSet objects together provide disconnected data access.
	- A DataSet is an in-memory data store that can hold one or more tables. DataSets only hold data and do not interact with the underlying database table.

=>  Rejectchanges is use for Undo the opration in our application

=>  The advantage of Strongly type dataset is show error at run time.
	- Ex: If we pass any wrong parameter or given wrong name then show error that time intellisense.

=>  Load data in database using xml to using SqlBulkCopy.
	- We can also able to copy one database to another database using xml SqlBulkQuery.

=>  Transaction ensures that either all of the database operations succeed or all of them fail.
	- This means the job is never half done, either all of it is done or nothing is done.
	- It's wirldly use the transection to money tranjection and also use to some creditional data transfer.
=>  Also practice today's video from above concepts.
